# Scroll of Power
This was a project to animate the solving of all the variables from each of the regents physics kinematic equations using Manim.



## Demo

## Inspiration

This code was inspired from a previous project: AMS161XManim, a project in which I tried to teach all of Calculus 2 in 5 minutes. I would say that previous project was (fairly) successful. I mainly wanted to leave this project just so that others may learn how I "*professionally*" (with severe air-quotes here) manipulate LaTex strings.\

This project, however, is probably never going to continue, it is most likely going to be discontinued.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project? Well... It's twofold. One, it's to share my knowledge with Kinematic equations Physics, with high school students that might have trouble with symbol manipulation (both via a preview on this very GitHub page, and YouTube)! Two, it's to share the code so that (maybe) someone can criticize my code, (especially since writing this code was a massive, massive pain). Criticizing this code would be a great form of compliments for me, because it means that someone actually put in the time to read the code, and mention how I can make the code better in the future. Thank you for reading.
